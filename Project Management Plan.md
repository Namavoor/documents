 For more details, refer to the development plan documents and functional requirements in the stakeholder. 


### 4. Project goal 


The main project goals are
	- The primary goal is to deploy the product in off-grid homes in India 
	- To achieve product-level maturity to commercialize in the future either with a license or support a potential customer 
	- Learn the full development cycle of the product with V cycle model in an automotive way 


### 5. Project location 


The  project is efficiently managed on the widely-used development platform, GitHub, under the organization named "Namavoor." Within this organization, there exist numerous individual repositories, each with its distinct purpose. One can analogize each repository as an autonomous folder within the broader organization's directory structure.


### 6. Project documentation




You can find all the necessary documentation for the project in the dedicated "documents" repository. As a best practice, all documentation files shall be created and maintained exclusively in markdown format. To ensure high accuracy and consistency, any updates to the documents are only accepted through pull requests. Further, to be consistent, the draw.io is used for block diagrams and PlantUML for sequence diagrams. To learn more about being consistent, please refer to the "documents" repository guidelines. 

Note: Good practice to check the repository specific details in read me file of the corresponding repository if needed 


### 7. Project communication


In order to facilitate effective communication and encourage discussion amongst everyone involved in a project, the use of "GitHub discussions" is highly recommended. This platform allows team members to ask questions, share new ideas, and engage in other forms of collaborative communication.

To ensure that discussions are organized and easy to follow, it is recommended that the "Labels" field be utilized. This allows for clear categorization of topics and makes it easier for everyone to find the information they need.

If voice and video communication is necessary, Google Meet is the ideal solution. This online meeting platform offers a seamless way to connect with team members, facilitate discussions, and ensure that everyone is on the same page.

By combining these different tools and platforms, teams can work together more efficiently and effectively, ultimately achieving better outcomes and higher levels of success.


### 8. Project work 


We welcome anyone who is interested in working on the project, whether it be contributing to feature development, addressing issues, improving documentation, or suggesting ways to enhance the project. This directly contributes to the project goal and the philosophy behind it. 

To begin working on a project, follow these simple steps:

1. Browse through the listed issues and choose one that interests you. If you don't find something you like, create a new issue and give it a descriptive title and a clear explanation of the problem.
2. Assign yourself to the issue you wish to work on. This informs other team members that you are actively working on that task.
3. Create a pull request with the issue number and the word "closes" in the description. This helps to link your pull request to the issue, making it easier for others to track your progress. Don't forget to follow the repository's branching strategy when creating your pull request.
4. Get started on the task assigned to you and work diligently until it is completed.
5. Once you're done, create a review by submitting a merge pull request. This notifies other team members that your work is ready to be reviewed and merged into the codebase.
6. Following these steps will help you stay organized and work efficiently on the project. Good luck!
